# Bad Spelling Generator
Bad spelling generator re-spells text while keeping the pronunciation the same. See it live at [badspellinggenerator.com](https://www.bsg.ethanr.co.uk)

This repo includes the **webapp** (source for the website).

The **scripts** (which create files for use in the website, as well as contains the Jupyter notebook that was used to create data visualisations) can be found [here](https://github.com/ethanr-2000/bad-spelling-generator-scripts)
